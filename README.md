# Blog & Informative Site

This is a simple blog and information website powered by Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

## How to use

1. **Create the repository**  
   Name it exactly: `vkgaider.github.io` (your GitHub username + `.github.io`).

2. **Add these files**  
   Upload all files and folders as shown.

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**  
   Go to your repo’s Settings → Pages and make sure it’s publishing from the `main` branch.

4. **Visit your site**  
   After a few minutes, your site will be live at [https://vkgaider.github.io](https://vkgaider.github.io).

## Making new blog posts

- Add markdown files to the `_posts` directory.
- Name them like: `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md`
- Each file needs this at the top:

  ```
  ---
  layout: post
  title:  "Your Post Title"
  date:   YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +0000
  categories: blog
  ---
  ```

Enjoy your new blog!
